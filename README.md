# Haar Dashboard

Haar Dashboard is a front-end UI for [Haar API](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-api).  

The Haar project has been the focus of my Honours year for BSc Computer Science at the Robert Gordon University. There are five related repositories:

- [Haar Engine](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-engine) - An IoT application framework
- [Haar API](https://github.com/stuartalexwhitehead/haar-api) - An implementation of Haar Engine
